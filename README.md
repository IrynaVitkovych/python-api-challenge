module 6 challenge/Pymaceuticals, Inc

Part 1: WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
Generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination using the citipy Python library.
Then with OpenWeatherMap API retrive weather for each city and base on it create plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude. 
Such as:
Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed


While working on this module, I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT, tutor sessions, and some codes from lessons' activities which helped me build and run the code.
