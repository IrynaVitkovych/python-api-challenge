module 6 challenge/Pymaceuticals, Inc

Part 1: WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
Generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination using the citipy Python library.
Then with OpenWeatherMap API retrive weather for each city and base on it create plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude. 
Such as:
Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed
And last separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude) to calculate the liner regression for each.

Part 2: VacationPy
Show how  weather data helps to plan future vacations. Use Geoapify API.


While working on this module, I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT, and some codes from lessons' activities which helped me build and run the code.
